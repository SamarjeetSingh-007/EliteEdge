# 🚀 GET YOUR FIREBASE CONFIG - FINAL STEP!

I can see your Firebase project is ready! Now let's get your config.

## Step 1: Get Your Config from Firebase Console

1. In your Firebase Console (the tab you have open)
2. Click the **⚙️ Settings** icon → **Project settings**
3. Scroll down to **"Your apps"** section
4. If you don't see a web app, click **"Add app"** → **Web** `</>`
   - App nickname: **"EliteEdge Website"**
   - Click **"Register app"**
5. You'll see a config like this:

```javascript
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "AIzaSyC-example-key-here",
  authDomain: "eliteedge-12345.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "eliteedge-12345", 
  storageBucket: "eliteedge-12345.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "123456789012",
  appId: "1:123456789012:web:abcdef123456"
};
```

## Step 2: Copy Your EXACT Config

Copy everything between the `{` and `}` including all the quotes and commas.

## Step 3: Tell Me Your Config

Once you have it, just paste it here and I'll update your firebase-config.js file automatically!

## ✅ What Happens Next:

Once updated:
- Your "Sample Project" from Firebase will appear on your website instantly! 🎉
- Any new projects added through admin panel will sync to Firebase
- Projects will be visible on ALL devices immediately
- Real-time updates without page refresh

Your Firebase integration is 99% complete - just need that config! 🔥
